the club isn't the best place to find a lover
so the bar is where i go
me and my friends at the table doing shots
drinking fast and then we talk slow
and you come over and start up a conversation with just me
and trust me i'll give it a chance now
take my hand, stop, put van the man on the jukebox
and then we start to dance, and now i'm singing like

girl, you know i want your love
your love was handmade for somebody like me
come on now, follow my lead
i may be crazy, don't mind me
say, boy, let's not talk too much
grab on my waist and put that body on me
come on now, follow my lead
come, come on now, follow my lead

i'm in love with the shape of you
we push and pull like a magnet do
although my heart is falling too
i'm in love with your body
and last night you were in my room
and now my bed sheets smell like you
every day discovering something brand new
i'm in love with your body
oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
i'm in love with your body
oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
i'm in love with your body
oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
i'm in love with your body
every day discovering something brand new
i'm in love with the shape of you
one week in we let the story begin
we're going out on our first date
you and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
fill up your bag and i fill up a plate
we talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
and how your family is doing okay
leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
tell the driver make the radio play, and i'm singing like

girl, you know i want your love
your love was handmade for somebody like me
come on now, follow my lead
i may be crazy, don't mind me
say, boy, let's not talk too much
grab on my waist and put that body on me
come on now, follow my lead
come, come on now, follow my lead

i'm in love with the shape of you
we push and pull like a magnet do
although my heart is falling too
i'm in love with your body
and last night you were in my room
and now my bed sheets smell like you
every day discovering something brand new
i'm in love with your body
oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
i'm in love with your body
oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
i'm in love with your body
oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
i'm in love with your body
every day discovering something brand new
i'm in love with the shape of you
come on, be my baby, come on
come on, be my baby, come on
come on, be my baby, come on
come on, be my baby, come on
come on, be my baby, come on
come on, be my baby, come on
come on, be my baby, come on
come on, be my baby, come on

i'm in love with the shape of you
we push and pull like a magnet do
although my heart is falling too
i'm in love with your body
last night you were in my room
and now my bed sheets smell like you
every day discovering something brand new
i'm in love with your body
come on, be my baby, come on
come on, be my baby, come on

i'm in love with your body

i'm in love with the shape of youabout13 contributorsed sheeran released “shape of you” together with “castle on the hill.” the two songs were the first releases from his third album, ÷ (divide), following in the mathematical footsteps of his +  (plus) and x (multiply) albums.
“shape of you” is based around a tropical house-inspired lead melody and dancehall beat. a rhythm is given by xylophones, guitars, and percussions. the style and rhythm have been noted as close to the  sia successes, “cheap thrills”, which has caused some controversy. ed has denied receiving inspiration from the track. just like “cheap thrills”, however, “shape of you” was written with the intention of it being recorded by rihanna, but sheeran later decided to keep it for himself.
in the song, sheeran sings about meeting someone at a bar and falling in love with her; a love distinct from those in much of his previous work as it’s more focused on the physical than the emotional.
sheeran had teased the song through a tweet that he had posted on january 5, 2017. the video had a colon that would then merge into a human body, referencing the “body”-inspiration of the song.
as of august 29, 2017, “shape of you” set a billboard record, spending 33 straight weeks in the top 10 of the hot 100 chart.
on september 22, 2017, the track became the most streamed song of all time on the spotify plaform at 1.318 billion plays. sheeran passed drake who previously held the record with “one dance.”
the song won a grammy best pop solo performance at the 2018 grammys held on january 28, 2018.
on january 24th, 2019, “shape of you” was certified diamond by the riaa, selling over ten million units.expand ⬎ask us a question about this songask a questiontranslationsgenius answer3 contributors

+13was the song originally meant to be on ed's new album?verified commentaryed sheeranvia radio 1 breakfast show is actually a really random one because i went in to write songs for other people with a guy called steve mac and johnny mcdaid, and we were writing this song and i was like “this would really work for rihanna,” and then i started singing lyrics like “putting van the man on the jukebox,” and i was like, “well, she’s not really going to sing that, is she?” and then we sort of decided halfway through that we were just going to make it for me.
this came really, really late. this was the last song that was finished, and i just didn’t put two and two together that it was even gonna be on the album at all. i just wrote it and i was like, “oh, that was fun,” and kept it from my label. and then one day i was like, “oh, do you reckon rudimental would want to do something to this?” and they were like, “why haven’t you played us this before?”+206how has ed responded to the comparison of this song to sia's "cheap thrills"?genius answer1 contributorpeople keep telling me it sounds like sia. i listened to the sia song and it’s completely different chords, completely different concept, completely different melody but there’s a marimba. do you know who coined it and who i reckon so many people have ripped off? kygo. kygo was the first to come with all this tropical house stuff and everyone’s just sorta picked it apart.
